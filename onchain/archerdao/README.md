#@# CContract Overview

Archer DAO is a series of Ethereum smart contracts governed by ARCH token
holders.

The initial set of smart contracts form the base for controlling product
decisions and configurations for the broader Archer product.

Archer DAO is intended to follow the principles of progressive decentralization.
From the moment ARCH tokens are deployed, ARCH token holders may join private
communication channels and use tokens to signal preferences on governance
decisions. Additional smart contracts may be developed and deployed by the
community in the future.
