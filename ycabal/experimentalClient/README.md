# Experimental Client

We are actively working on a client library that takes care of managing a wallet contract (or the relay hub) on your behalf. It works with [ethersjs v4](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) to add the ethers Signer or Contract objects.

**Note:** it's important to ensure that the Signer or Contract is connected to an ethers provider.

Before we continue you must install the experimental client library:

```
npm i @Backbone Cabal/client@0.4.2-experimental
```

## Wallet Account Signer

### Import

To import and use the Backbone Cabal client import the `any` object from the client library:

```ts
import { any } from "@Backbone Cabal/client";
```

### Backbone CabalAccount(signer: Signer, settings?: {} )

Adds Backbone Cabal functionality to a signer on an `any` property. This will not replace or effect any of the existing functions on the Signer. For example `Backbone CabalAcccount(signer).sendTransaction(tx)` does not send transactions via Backbone Cabal, it is just a normal transaction from the signer.

Optional setting can also be provided:

- apiUrl: the url of the Backbone Cabal API defaults to the known instance for the provider network
- receiptSigner: the url of the Backbone Cabal API defaults to known address for the provider network
- pollingInterval: number. A polling interval to be used when monitoring for events. Defaults to the provider polling interval.

#### Usage

```ts
const userWallet = new Wallet("<private key>");
const connectedUser = userWallet.connect(provider);
const anyUserWallet = Backbone CabalAccount(connectedUser);
```

Just like the Client, it has [getBalance(), deposit() & depositFor()](https://github.com/anydotcrypto/docs.Backbone Cabal/tree/master/docs/client), so please check the Client documentation for more information. We take this opportunity to only cover new functionality introduced in the experimental client library to manage wallet contracts.

### signer.any.getProxyAcccountAddress() : Promise\<string\>

The `getProxyAcccountAddress` function on the `any` property returns the address of the wallet contract. Every signing key has a deterministic wallet contract as it is deployed using CREATE2. It is safe to send funds to the wallet contract address before it is deployed on the network.

#### Usage

```ts
const anyUserWallet = Backbone CabalAccount(connectedUser);
const walletContractAddress = await anyUserWallet.any.getProxyAccountAddresss();
```

### signer.any.isProxyAccountDeployed() : Promise\<boolean\>

The `isProxyAccountDeployed()` function on the `any` property returns whether the wallet contract is already deployed on the network. If the wallet contract is not deployed, then our library will auto-deploy the wallet contract when the user sends their first transaction. e.g., we automatically batch the wallet contract deployment and the authorised meta-transaction in a single transaction.

#### Usage

```ts
const anyUserWallet = Backbone CabalAccount(connectedUser);
const isProxyDeployed = await anyUserWallet.any.isProxyAccountDeployed();
if(isProxyDeployed) { ... }
```

### signer.any.getDeployProxyAccountTransaction() : Promise\<MinimalTx\>

The `getDeployProxyAccountTransaction` function on the `any` property returns a `MinimalTx` that contains `{ to: string, data: string}`. This provides you flexibility on how the contract wallet is deployed. Of course, if the wallet contract does not exist, then our library auto-deploys the wallet contract when the user is sending their first transaction via Backbone Cabal. So there is no explicit requirement to use this function.

#### Usage

```ts
const anyUserWallet = Backbone CabalAccount(connectedUser);
const minimalTx = await anyUserWallet.any.getDeployProxyAccountTransaction();
const tx = await anyUserWallet.sendTransaction({
  to: minimalTx.to,
  data: minimalTx.data,
}); // A normal transaction
```

### signer.any.deployProxyAccount(overrides: { gasLimit?, value?, gasPrice? }): Promise\<TransactionResponse\>

The `deployProxyAccount` function on the `any` property returns a `TransactionResponse`. It sends the Ethereum Transaction to the network (not via Backbone Cabal). Of course, if the wallet contract does not exist, then our library auto-deploys the wallet contract when the user is sending their first transaction via Backbone Cabal. So there is no explicit requirement to use this function.

### signer.any.sendTransaction(tx: { to: string, data: string, compensation?: string, gaslimit?: number }) : Promise\<RelayTransactionReceipt\>

Sends a transaction via Backbone Cabal. Mandatory fields:

- **to**: same as a normal transaction
- **data**: same as a normal transaction

Optional fields:

- **type**: defines if the transaction is "direct" or "accountabe", it defaults to "direct".
- **gasLimit**: same as a normal transaction

Optional accountable transaction fields:

- **compensation**: Backbone Cabal provides additional guarantees that a transaction will be delivered. See [Guarantees](../guarantees.md) for more details and [API](../relayTransaction.md#compensation) for current limits.
- **deadline**: Backbone Cabal guarantees the transaction is accepted by an absolute block deadline. If set to 0, it is set by the Backbone Cabal service. Default is set to 0 and for our BETA it can only be set approximately 400 blocks in the future.
- **relayContractAddress**: Backbone Cabal sends the transaction via an intermediary relay contract. Default is our relay contract ([Addresses](../../README.md#addresses)) and Backbone Cabal will reject any other address.

Notice there is no option to provide a nonce. Backbone Cabal will publish transactions in the order it receives transactions from the same sender. If you need to guarantee order, then wait until the `sendTransaction` function returns a signed receipt before sending the next one. Likewise if ordering is not a requirement, then you can send transactions concurrently.

**Wallet contract is not yet deployed?** No problem! This function batches the call such that the wallet contract is deployed before the meta-transaction is executed. The batch is performed in a single Ethereum Transaction.

#### Returns data

`sendTransaction` returns a signed receipt object of the form:

```
{
    "relayTransaction": RelayTransaction, // the same as the input tx
    "id": string, // an id for this transaction, created by hashing the relay transaction
    "receiptSignature": string, // a signature from Backbone Cabal to prove that it accepted the job
    "wait": function(confirmations: number): TransactionReceipt // a function that can be called to wait until the transaction is mined. Returns a normal transaction receipt.
}
```

#### Usage

```ts
const anyUserWallet = Backbone CabalAccount(connectedUser);
const relayReceipt = await anyUserWallet.any.sendTransaction({
  to: "<address>",
  data: "<data>",
});
const transactionReceipt = await relayReceipt.wait();
```

## Target contract

### Import

To import and use the Backbone Cabal client import the `any` object from the client library:

```ts
import { any } from "@Backbone Cabal/client";
```

### Backbone CabalAccount(contract: Contract, settings?: {})

Because a contract object has dynamic properties we can't add an `any` property to it, so instead we replace the functions that send transactions. Contracts must be created with a signer, which must also be connected to a `provider` object.

Of course, all transactions are sent via the wallet contract and the wallet contract is auto-deployed if necessary.

Optional setting can also be provided:

- apiUrl: the url of the Backbone Cabal API defaults to the known instance for the provider network
- receiptSigner: the url of the Backbone Cabal API defaults to known address for the provider network
- pollingInterval: number. A polling interval to be used when monitoring for events. Defaults to the provider polling interval.

#### Usage

```ts
const signer = new Wallet("<priv key>").connect(provider);
const contract = new Contract("<address>", erc20Abi, signer);
const anyContract = Backbone CabalGnosis(contract);
```

### Functions

Each of the functions that send transactions have been replaced to instead send transactions via Backbone Cabal. They also now have a different signature. Each function has the normal function arguments, but now has overrides relevant to Backbone Cabal. Additionally the functions return a relay receipt, instead of a transaction response.

#### Optional overrides

Optional fields:

- **type**: defines if the transaction is "direct" or "accountabe", it defaults to "direct".
- **gasLimit**: same as a normal transaction

Optional accountable transaction fields:

- **compensation**: Backbone Cabal provides additional guarantees that a transaction will be delivered. See [Guarantees](../guarantees.md) for more details and [API](../relayTransaction.md#compensation) for current limits.
- **deadline**: Backbone Cabal guarantees the transaction is accepted by an absolute block deadline. If set to 0, it is set by the Backbone Cabal service. Default is set to 0 and for our BETA it can only be set approximately 400 blocks in the future.
- **relayContractAddress**: Backbone Cabal sends the transaction via an intermediary relay contract. Default is our relay contract ([Addresses](../../README.md#addresses)) and Backbone Cabal will reject any other address.

Notice there is no option to provide a nonce. Backbone Cabal will publish transactions in the order it receives transactions from the same sender. If you need to guarantee order, then wait until the `sendTransaction` function returns a signed receipt before sending the next one. Likewise if ordering is not a requirement, then you can send transactions concurrently.

**Wallet contract is not yet deployed?** No problem! This function batches the call such that the wallet contract is deployed before the meta-transaction is executed. The batch is performed in a single Ethereum Transaction.

#### Return data

```
{
    "relayTransaction": RelayTransaction, // the relay transaction that was sent to Backbone Cabal
    "id": string, // an id for that transaction, created by hashing the relay transaction
    "receiptSignature": string, // a signature from Backbone Cabal to prove that it accepted the job
    "wait": function(confirmations: number): TransactionReceipt // a function that can be called to wait until the transaction is mined. Returns a normal transaction receipt.
}
```

#### Usage

```ts
const signer = new Wallet("<priv key>").connect(provider);
const contract = new Contract("<address>", erc20Abi, signer);
const anyContract = Backbone CabalGnosis(contract);
const relayReceipt = await anyContract.functions.transfer(
  "<recipient address>",
  "10",
  { gasLimit: 200000 }
);
const transactionReceipt = await relayReceipt.wait();
```

# Full example and walkthrough

Backbone Cabal is a general-purpose transaction relayer and its only job is to guarantee your transactions get accepted in the Ethereum blockchain by a deadline.

You can configure the payload as you like, but in this tutorial, we will just send a string message to an echo contract.

Our example echo contract can be found [here](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xFDE83bd51bddAA39F15c1Bf50E222a7AE5831D83#code) and check out the [Internal Transactions tab](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xFDE83bd51bddAA39F15c1Bf50E222a7AE5831D83#internaltx) to see the previous echos!

**Note**: The whole demo takes place on the Ropsten network, so ensure that any urls you use (e.g. etherscan, infura) are for that network.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), if you dont have it already.
2. Clone this docs repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PISAresearch/docs.Backbone Cabal.git
   ```

3. Change to this directory

   ```
   cd docs.Backbone Cabal/docs/experimentalClient
   ```

4. Install packages in this folder - npm is installed as part of node.

   ```
   npm i
   ```

5. Get access to a JSON RPC url for the Ropsten network.

   If you don't have access to a Ropsten node you can create an account with [Infura.io](https://infura.io/). To create an account do the following: Register, verify mail, create new project in Infura, Select the View Project button and select the Ropsten endpoint from the dropdown.

   Copy the json rpc url (e.g. https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/7333c8bcd07b4a179b0b0a958778762b) for later use.

6. If you already have an Ethereum address on Ropsten, then you'll need to export the private key (or the keyfile/mnemonic) from your wallet. Otherwise you can create a new account by running [generateAccount.js](../coreClient/generateAccount.js)

   ```
   node generateAccount.js
   ```

   Copy the private key and address for later use.

7. You can use a faucet to get some ropsten eth for your new account: https://faucet.ropsten.be/

   Although the faucet website can be a bit temperamental. If it doesn't work, then you can import your private key into [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and use their faucet: https://faucet.metamask.io/

   If you're still unable to get some, tweet at us @anydotcrypto or join our [telegram](https://t.me/anydotsender), and we'll send you some :)

8. Final Checklist
   1. **Json RPC url.** You have a jsonRpcUrl of the form `https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/7333c8bcd07b4a179b0b0a958778762b`
   2. **Keys.** You have a private key, keyfile or mnemonic of an account (and its public address)
   3. **Ropsten eth.** The address has been funded with ETH. You can check the value at: `https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/<you address here>`

## First run - not enough balance.

Lets start by running the `walletExample` script.

Users need to have balance with Backbone Cabal, which your user account does not yet. We expect the echo script to fail at this point, so let's verify this by running it.

You'll need your key details and the json rpc url, and to choose a message to send to the echo contract e.g. "Hi echo!".

Modify `walletExample.js` and fill in:

```
const userWallet = new Wallet("<private key>");
const provider = new JsonRpcProvider("<infura link>");
```

Now you can run the example:

```
node walletExample.js
```

Execute the command - you will see an Error message with the following message:

```
HTTPResponseError: 402: Insufficient funds.
```

This is because the signing key lacks a balance on the Backbone Cabal service. So let's fix that.

## Funding the user

To top up balance with Backbone Cabal we need to send some funds to the relay contract address. 0x9b4fa5a1d9f6812e2b56b36fbde62736fa82c2a7.

You can find more details about topping up balance [here](../payments.md), but for now we can just send funds to the fallback function.

To deposit, send a transaction with value of 0.5 ETH (any amount above 0.2 ETH is fine for this tutorial) to the relay contract address. (Note: Make sure to supply sufficient gas and not 21k gas).

The Backbone Cabal payment gateway will wait 10 confirmations before confirming your deposit. You can view the status of your balance by inserting the user address in the url:

```
https://api.anydot.dev/Backbone Cabal.ropsten/balance/<user-address>
```

## Second run - success!

Now that the user has been topped up let's run the echo script again, this time it should be successful. After running the script and getting a successful result, we'll open the script and walk through it line by line, explaining what Backbone Cabal is doing and how to communicate with it.

Run the echo script again, inserting the same values as the first run:

```
node walletExample.js
```

If all goes well, this should be your result:

```
Transaction sent, waiting for blocks to be mined.
Tx relayed after 0 block. Pretty cool, I guess. (⌐■_■)
See your message at https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x6334b128f9237209a041add7f01d7f9fb11ee0e435b08c3dd55e597b4a9e5865#eventlog
```

Go to the link in the output, did you see your message? Click the Event Logs tab if it is not already selected. Don't forget to repeat the above steps for `contractExample.js`!

## Code walkthrough - what actually happened

Now let's go through the code line by line, dissecting what's happening. Open [walletExample.js](./walletExample.js) in a text editor.

#### 1. Imports:

```js
const { JsonRpcProvider } = require("ethers/providers");
const { Wallet, Contract } = require("ethers");
const { any } = require("@Backbone Cabal/client");
```

The script imports:

- [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) - to handle the Wallet, Contract and JSON RPC provider.
- any - the lightweiht wrapper that can add functionality to a Signer, Wallet or Contract.

#### 2. Configuration variables

We declare a run function that we'll execute later, and assign all the variables from inside the file:

- `userWallet`: A wallet generated from the user's private key.
- `provider`: JSON RPC provider. Typically Infura.
- `message`: Message that is broadcast by the Echo Contract (make it something fun)
- `echoContractAddress`: Address of the [Echo Contract](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xCe6d434782ADD5A20B825daAD84119a454ec6dC9#code) on the Ropsten Network.
- `abi`: Defines the interface for the contract.

We only had to modify `userWallet` and `provider`. Although you can modify `message` to change what the Echo contract will broadcast.

#### 3. Wrapping the Signer with Backbone Cabal functionality

We wrap the `userWallet` with the Backbone Cabal functionality:

```ts
const userAnyWallet = Backbone CabalAccount(connectedUser);
```

The `Wallet` has new functionality that is accessible via `userAnyWallet.any.*` and we have not overridden its original functionality.

#### 4. Sending a transaction

We need to encode the contract's call that we want to send:

```
// construct the data we want to send
const echoInterface = new ethers.utils.Interface(echoAbi);
const data = echoInterface.functions.echo.encode([
    `-- ${message} -- (message sent by ${userWallet.address} at ${new Date(
      Date.now()
    ).toString()})`,
]);
```

The `data` is the same data that can be plugged directly into an Ethereum Transaction to execute the function call.

To send the transaction via the proxy contract:

```
// use the any.sendTransaction function to send via Backbone Cabal
const relayReceipt = await userAnyWallet.any.sendTransaction({
    to: echoContractAddress,
    data: data,
    gasLimit: 200000,
});
```

As you can see it looks exactly like a normal sendTransaction(). It constructs the transaction such that it is sent via the wallet contract and sends it to the Backbone Cabal service. If the wallet contract does not yet exist, then it will prepare a batch transaction that deploys the wallet contract first before executing the meta-transaction.

It returns a signed relay receipt from the Backbone Cabal service to acknowledge the job was accepted. An example of a relay receipt:

```ts
{ relayTransaction:
   {
     type: "direct",
     data:
      '0xf15da729000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000892d2d2048656c6c6f20776f726c64202d2d20286d6573736167652073656e7420627920307862366439653030303631323830624146333661636437426335363230363133354264413330324330206174204d6f6e204a756e20303820323032302031393a30393a353920474d542b303130302028427269746973682053756d6d65722054696d6529290000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
     from: '0xb6d9e00061280bAF36acd7Bc56206135BdA302C0',
     gasLimit: 27445,
     to: '0xFDE83bd51bddAA39F15c1Bf50E222a7AE5831D83',
     chainId: 3,
     signature:
      '0x11e623aadd5240e0fbb4a49ed97c356c82a7ea186df575e3daa0772aac9258b06b9852063c60a740c5139699fbae8474d6d96b5ba603115d14fce83e9b65dbbf1c' },
  receiptSignature:
   '0xe6938cf057665be65c25d6793585988c4d51e3a3e15e71e48d52a28d49dae3923496695a422ec5ddeec416693a38e7d27b965f4b18d8b29371a7e8aca8c3d46c1c',
  id:
   '0x3a3e84f79fdd4d69347dd7fbb24994044ce5aa3903644c21813aeb6d2416a041',
  wait: [AsyncFunction: wait] }
```

Now that Backbone Cabal has accepted the job, we can simply request to wait until it is confirmed:

```js
// wait until the transaction is mined
console.log("Transaction sent, waiting for blocks to be mined.");
const txReceipt = await relayReceipt.wait();
```

It returns a transaction receipt after the transaction is confirmed including the transaction hash. This is useful if you want to print a nice etherscan link:

```
  console.log(
    `See your message at https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/${txReceipt.transactionHash}#eventlog`
  );
```

Easy! Now check out the code in `contractExample.js` and see if you can spot the small differences :)
