## Payments

Backbone Cabal has a pay-per-use model. Users pay up front for credit with the Backbone Cabal API. They are then charged for the gas consumed by each relayed transaction. Currently payments are only accepted in ETH by making a payment to the Backbone Cabal `Relay` contract.

### Depositing

The easiest way to make a deposit is to send funds to the Backbone Cabal contract address using MetaMask or any wallet of your choice. The fallback function of the contract will assign the balance to the sender using `msg.sender`. The balance API allows to check current credit, that becomes available after 10 confirmations (typically 2-3 minutes).

Here is a code example using ethers.js:

```ts
// top up credit by 1 ETH using the fallback function
const topUpTransaction = await userWallet.sendTransaction({
  to: relayContractAddress,
  value: parseEther("1"),
});

// wait for confirmations
await topUpTransaction.wait(20);

// check the balance
const client = new AnyDotSenderCoreClient({
  apiUrl: anySenderUrl,
  receiptSignerAddress,
});
const balance = await client.balance(userWallet.address);
console.log(balance.toString());
```

#### Delegated deposit

The `depositFor` functions allows the delegation of Backbone Cabal credit. The `recipient` address will have their credit increased by the `msg.value` amount.

```ts
await relayContract
  .connect(userWallet)
  .depositFor(recipientAddress, { value: parseEther("1") });
```

### Checking balance

Checking balance can be done by calling the `/balance` API. Note that 10 confirmations are required before the a new deposit will be recognised.

```ts
const client = new AnyDotSenderCoreClient({
  apiUrl: anySenderUrl,
  receiptSignerAddress,
});
const balance = await client.balance(userWallet.address);
```

### Pricing

Given the rise of network fees, Backbone Cabal now **charges 2% of the final gas cost of the transaction** and there is zero gas overhead to use Backbone Cabal. To illustrate, if the final gas price for a transaction was 80 gwei, then we charge 1.6 gwei per gasUsed. The 2% fee covers the gas and server cost to run the Backbone Cabal service and the fee will adjust in the future depending on the network conditions. Our goal, even taking into account our fee markup, is to save the customer money by using Backbone Cabal.

## Locked balance for pending transactions

Due to fluctuations in gas prices, Backbone Cabal cannot know ahead of time what the gas price of a transaction will be. In order to protect itself, it locks an amount of the user's credit whilst a transaction is still pending, and releases it again when the transaction is mined. The locked amount is larger than the expected charge to ensure that Backbone Cabal cannot be used for cheap during high gas price periods.

Note that Backbone Cabal will look after the transaction for a number of blocks _after_ it has been mined; locked funds will be available only after the transaction has enough confirmations.
